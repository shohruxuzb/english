      <p>Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3124638/it-industry/why-bots-are-poised-to-disrupt-the-enterprise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="230 million or more">230 million or more</a> knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new jobs while altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated"> less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated</a>, but about 60 percent can be partially automated.</p>
      <p>For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand latest technology trends, RPA offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution architect and consultant. And these jobs pay well- making it the next technology trend you must keep a watch on! Mastering RPA will help you secure high-paying jobs like:</p>

      <p>Formerly a new technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/azure-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Microsoft Azure">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/google-cloud-platform-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Google Cloud Platform">Google Cloud Platform</a> dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it’s no longer the emerging technology trend. Edge is.</p>
      <p>As the quantity of data organizations is dealing with continues to increase, they have realized the shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data center for processing. It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters.</p>
      <p>Keeping in line with cloud computing (including new-age edge and quantum computing) will help you grab amazing jobs like:</p>

      <p>The next remarkable technology trend is <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/ai-and-blockchain-with-quantum-computing-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="quantum computing">quantum computing</a>, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.</p>
      <p>Quantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk, Honeywell, Microsoft, AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of Quantum Computing. The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1067216/global-quantum-computing-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="$2.5 billion by 2029.">$2.5 billion by 2029.</a> And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability, information theory, and machine learning.</p>

      <p>The next exceptional technology trend - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), and Extended Reality (ER). VR immerses the user in an environment while AR enhances their environment. Although this technology trend has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with<a href="https://gdit.com/maritime-simulation-virtualship" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="VirtualShip"> VirtualShip</a>, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains.</p>
      <p>In 2024, we can expect these forms of technologies being further integrated into our lives. Usually working in tandem with some of the other emerging technologies we’ve mentioned in this list, AR and VR have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to train doctors to do surgery, offer museum goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, or even enhance marketing, as with this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go9rf9GmYpM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Pepsi Max bus shelter"> Pepsi Max bus shelter</a>.</p>
      <p>While some employers might look for optics as a skill-set, note that getting started in VR doesn’t require a lot of specialized knowledge - basic <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/programming-bootcamp-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="programming skills">programming skills</a> and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job; another reason why this new technology trend should make up to your list of lookouts!</p>

      <p>Although most people think of <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/blockchain-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="blockchain technology">blockchain technology</a> in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In simplest terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from, or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third party to oversee or validate transactions.</p>
      <p>Several industries are involving and implementing blockchain, and as blockchain technology&#x27;s use increases, so does the demand for skilled professionals. From a birds eye view, a <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/how-to-become-a-blockchain-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="blockchain developer">blockchain developer</a> specializes in developing and implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology. </p>

      <p>Another promising new technology trend is IoT. Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. The <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-iot-how-and-why-it-matters-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Internet of Things">Internet of Things</a> is the future, and has already enabled devices, home appliances, cars and much more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet.</p>
      <p>As consumers, we’re already using and benefitting from IoT. We can lock our doors remotely if we forget to when we leave for work and preheat our ovens on our way home from work, all while tracking our fitness on our Fitbits. However, <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/ways-businesses-use-iot-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="businesses">businesses </a>also have much to gain now and in the near future. The IoT can enable better safety, efficiency and decision making for businesses as data is collected and analyzed. It can enable predictive maintenance, speed up medical care, improve customer service, and offer benefits we haven’t even imagined yet.</p>
      <p>And we’re only in the beginning stages of this new technology trend: Forecasts suggest that by 2030 around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/802690/worldwide-connected-devices-by-access-technology/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="50 billion">50 billion </a>of these IoT devices will be in use around the world, creating a massive web of interconnected devices spanning everything from smartphones to kitchen appliances.
